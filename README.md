This is my first try using Github for program development.  The program in question is to be written in Python.  It's a small RSA program I wrote to make sure I understood the concepts.


I've come back to this thing in January 2017.  My current OS defaults to running Python 3 instead of Python 2.  The program here will not work under 3 without modifications.  Oh well, I might come back and make a Python 3 version at some point.  Not sure.
