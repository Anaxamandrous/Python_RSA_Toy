This is my first try using Github for program development.  The program in question is to be written in Python.  It will act as a chat program, able to listen for connection requests and to make connection requests.  When a connection is established, the chat program uses RSA to exchange an AES session key.  The chat is then encrypted using that session key.

As one goal in writing this program is to learn the behind-the-scenes workings of RSA, AES, and eventually other cryptographic algorithms, this program will feature the minimum number of external dependencies possible given the skill set of the developer(s).
